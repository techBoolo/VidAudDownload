### ðŸš¨ **Important: Use the `dev` Branch** ðŸš¨

This project uses a Git workflow where the most up-to-date code with the latest features and bug fixes resides on the **`dev`** branch. The `main` branch may be a stable but older version.

To ensure you are using the correct and most complete version of this application, please make sure you are on the `dev` branch after cloning the repository.

```bash
# After cloning, switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev
```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python 3.8+**
2.  **pip** (usually included with Python)
3.  **Git**
4.  **ffmpeg:** This is a **critical dependency** for merging video and audio streams. `yt-dlp` will not be able to download the best quality formats without it.
    -   Follow the official installation guide here: [yt-dlp Dependencies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#dependencies)

    ```
    Alternatively, you can install them manually:
    ```bash
    pip install PySide6 yt-dlp

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
*(On some systems, you may need to use `python3`)*

---
### `requirements.txt` File

For easy installation, create a file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your `main.py` file with the following content:

```
pyside6
yt-dlp
```
```

This README file clearly sets expectations, emphasizes the required branch, and provides all the necessary steps for another developer (or your future self) to get the project running smoothly.
